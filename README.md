# Concrète Mixer internet radio Docker image

This repo contains files for a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that runs:
- [Concrète Mixer](https://github.com/concrete-mixer/concrete-mixer) - an ambient sound file mixing audio app
- [Darkice](http://www.darkice.org)
- [Icecast](https://icecast.org)

The image is intended to run on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to provide a closet-based internet radio station.

# Prerequisites

A Raspberry Pi, preferably a model 3, preferably running Raspbian (though I _think_ any Linux with systemd should be fine), definitely running Docker. An internet connection is also a must.

# Installation

## Install snd-aloop module

The Docker container makes use of the ALSA snd-aloop module. Concrete Mixer directs sends its output to device Loopback,0 while Darkice listens for the output on Loopback,1. To set up snd-aloop to load on boot, run:

    sudo -i
    echo snd-aloop >> /etc/modules
    reboot

When the pi reboots, run `aplay -l` and in the sound hardware components listed you should see:

    card 0: Loopback [Loopback], device 0: Loopback PCM [Loopback PCM]
      Subdevices: 8/8
      ...
    card 0: Loopback [Loopback], device 1: Loopback PCM [Loopback PCM]
      Subdevices: 8/8
      ...

## Installing the docker image

With Docker installed on your pi, run:

    docker run -d --device=/dev/snd:/dev/snd -p 8000:8000 concretemixer/cm-rpi-internet:latest

Docker will download the image from dockerhub and build and run a new container.

All going well, at the end of the process you should hear Concrète Mixer playing on __http://{your Pi's ip address}:8000/concrete-mixer.mp3__.

## Setting the docker container to load on boot

To do this:

1. Copy the contents of [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concrete-mixer/cm-rpi-docker-internet/master/docker-concrete_mixer_internet.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/docker-concrete_mixer_internet.service`:

2. Restart systemd so the new file is detected:

    `systemctl daemon-reload`

3. Enable the service:

    `systemctl enable docker-concrete_mixer_internet.service`

4. Reboot the pi, and the Concrète Mixer service should start automatically.

# Security

The `conf/icecast2.xml` file provides a default username and password. If you ever expose your Pi to the internet you should fork this repo, and specify secure credentials in `conf/icecast2.xml` and `conf/darkice.cfg`.
